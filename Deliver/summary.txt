I have used 4 models: DecisionTreeClassifier(), LogisticRegression(),  KNeighborsClassifier(), GaussianNB(). 

Moreover, I also used Cross Validation with number of fold equals to 10. The results I got are: 

mean_accuracy	model
1	0.816129	LogisticRegression()
2	0.808065	KNeighborsClassifier()
3	0.806452	GaussianNB()
4	0.803226	DecisionTreeClassifier()

From the table above, we can say that the model with Logistic Regression algorithm provides us highest accuracy.
