# Titanic-HW
This is a project that I worked with Titanic data. The aim of this project is to build a model that predict the survive status of customer on the trip. 

There are four algorithms that I used to build the model. Here is the detail:

mean_accuracy    model
1    0.816129    LogisticRegression()
2    0.808065    KNeighborsClassifier()
3    0.806452    GaussianNB()
0    0.803226    DecisionTreeClassifier()

- You can find the code in Notebooks folder and the data in Data folder.
